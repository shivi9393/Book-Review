        <h2>Rich Dad Poor Dad</h2>
        <p>"Rich Dad Poor Dad" by Robert T. Kiyosaki is a personal finance book that contrasts the financial philosophies of the author's two father figures: his biological father (Poor Dad) and his best friend's father (Rich Dad). Through their differing approaches to money, work, and investing, Kiyosaki illustrates the importance of financial education, investing in assets, and developing an entrepreneurial mindset to achieve financial independence.
